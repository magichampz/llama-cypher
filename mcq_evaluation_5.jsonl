{"topic": "Penetration Testing Lifecycle, Workflows, Methodologies", "subtopic": "Planning Phase", "question": "A healthcare provider is preparing for a penetration test that will include legacy infusion pumps connected to an electronic health record (EHR) system. Which of the following considerations is MOST critical to address in the planning phase to avoid unintended patient safety risks, given the operational constraints of clinical environments?", "options": ["A. Ensuring that penetration testers have physical access to all medical devices during business hours", "B. Coordinating with biomedical engineering to schedule downtime for the EHR system during testing", "C. Defining clear rules of engagement that specify test boundaries, device criticality, and fail-safe procedures for devices with direct patient impact", "D. Reviewing device vendor documentation for vulnerability disclosures prior to testing"], "correct_answer": "C"}
{"topic": "Penetration Testing Lifecycle, Workflows, Methodologies", "subtopic": "Planning Phase", "question": "During the planning phase of a penetration test in a large hospital, the security team is debating the scope of testing for connected radiology devices that handle Protected Health Information (PHI). What is the most nuanced risk of excluding vendor-managed devices from the test scope, considering healthcare regulatory and operational realities?", "options": ["A. Exclusion may lead to non-compliance with HIPAA breach notification rules if a vulnerability is later exploited", "B. It creates a false sense of security by leaving untested attack vectors within the hospital network that could be leveraged to access PHI", "C. Vendor-managed devices are typically patched more frequently, making them a lower risk to exclude from testing", "D. Exclusion only delays vulnerability discovery until the next vendor security assessment, which fulfills regulatory requirements"], "correct_answer": "B"}
{"topic": "Penetration Testing Lifecycle, Workflows, Methodologies", "subtopic": "Planning Phase", "question": "In the planning phase of a medical device penetration test, the team must align with both hospital legal counsel and device manufacturers. Which subtle but critical challenge is MOST likely to arise when negotiating testing permissions, especially for devices classified as Class II under FDA regulations?", "options": ["A. The hospital legal team may insist on full source code review, which device manufacturers often prohibit", "B. Device manufacturers may require test activities to be conducted only in isolated labs, undermining real-world risk assessment", "C. Ensuring that test outcomes can be shared in vulnerability databases without violating proprietary information agreements", "D. FDA regulations forbid any penetration testing on Class II devices outside of post-market surveillance"], "correct_answer": "B"}
